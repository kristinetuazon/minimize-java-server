Meet Emily--young and career driven. She currently works at consulting and is dealing with stress often. She often finds herself using retail therapy to destress. A friend pointed out that it may be an addiction. She wants an app that could help her sort over her things and help her keep track of what is sorted and what is not.

Meet Tim--a digital nomad, and a person who travels everywhere all the time. He doesn't own much, but sometimes it is hard to know what he needs. He wants an application that will allow him to keep track of what he brought in what trip and also help him double check and sort through the things he's bringing.

<br />
<br />

Inspired by Marie Kondo's "what sparks joy" and the Minimalist lifestyle--Minimize aspires to help you sort through your things (clothes, books---anything) in three categories: yes, no and maybe.

For this project, I decided to work with Java as a language to create a server. I used Spring, a Java backend framework to create it. By using [Spring Initializ](https://start.spring.io/), I started this project.

## Personal Reflections
<br />

<br />
<br />
This project gave me the opportunity to reinforce my understanding about the backend and it's architecture more than Java as a language itself. The Spring framework made it simple and quick to create a REST API in Java. Initially I didn't know what the service layer, persistence layer and the presentation layer were until working in this project.

<br />
<br />
I had a difficult time deploying due to the mismatched versions of Maven and Java. After a few attempts, I managed to deploy and have it run in Heroku as a rest API.
